# Aniruddh Ravipati's Portfolio
A website to showcase my work as an interaction designer! This is the third version the portfolio within a year. Build,Test, Repeat!

This is also serves as a way to commit to my multi-disciplinary side on a deeper level. This website shall grow to include not just product design work but also my work at CIID, and other future art and design works.

## Process 

### Step 1 : Verplank Model 

Verplank model is a well-known model within Interaction Design theory which helps clarify the core interaction for the product [Here is a pdf by Bill Verplank himself that explains how to use this framework](http://www.billverplank.com/IxDSketchBook.pdf)

The key idea behind the metaphor - *opening a gift* - is not a value judgement on the quality of my work but rather it speaks to the aesthetic of the interaction itself. Consider all that a wrapped present conveys - it contains something that is for you to see, however it is hidden away by ribbon and wrap. 

This particular metaphor seems to fit in with how I wanted to convey information - each layer of information led to deeper information unlocked by the interactions. The interactions themselves would take inspiration from the methaphor - one pulls at the ribbon and then removes the wrap - two interactions that would work with each other to reveal a layer that would reveal more information. 

### Step 2 : Wireframes

With this step, I wanted to experiment with the aesthetics of the would-be website and how the layers would be presented. If we were sticking to the metaphor (and we are straining it a bit here), this is the stage where one decides which color the wrap will be, what patterns will it have on it, is it shiny?, which knot to use for the ribbon?

I liked the last one - it was simple but had space for some dynamic backgrounds that would add a certain shine to the portfolio. The next step was to figure out the UX for this style.
